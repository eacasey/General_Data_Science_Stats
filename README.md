#### General_Data_Science_Stats
Repository for general data science info, statistics, and coding 

## This repository contains information about general data science and statistics topics as well as some fundamental code (primarily Python) that I have found myself referring to on a regular basis. I decided to create a repository for it here in case anyone else finds it helpful.

# Files in this repository: 

- [Coding_Fundamentals (3).ipynb](https://github.com/eacasey/General_Data_Science_Stats/blob/main/Coding_Fundamentals%20(3).ipynb) 
- [ML_Review_of_Techniques_Concepts (1).xlsx](https://github.com/eacasey/General_Data_Science_Stats/blob/main/ML%20Review%20of%20Techniques_Concepts%20(1).xlsx)
